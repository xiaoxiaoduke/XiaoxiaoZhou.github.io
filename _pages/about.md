Welcome to Xiaoxiao's personal website! 

I'm  currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University under the mentorship of Fan Li. Excitingly, I'll be transitioning into the role of Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham this fall.

My passion is rooted in real-world applications in biomedicine with a focus on causal inference. I also delve into longitudinal data analysis and survival analysis, exploring ways to unlock insights from complex datasets.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I thrive on activities like weightlifting, mountain hiking, wall climbing, and runningâ€”always up for a new adventure!
